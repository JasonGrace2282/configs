# Configs
My configuration files for:
* Kitty
* Neovim
* zsh
* 
and other configuration files I decide to put in here.
Note that these are not stand-alone. If you want to use the zsh config for example, you will have to build and make certain packages in the `~/src` directory. Typically you will find that these packages are ones with `source ~/src/plugin.zsh` at the very end of the file.
